## Project Overview

This project aims to build a scalable ride-hailing app with the following core functionalities:

- **User address search** with autocomplete and geocoding (converting addresses to GPS coordinates)
- **Route calculation** between pickup and drop-off points including driving distance and estimated time
- **Driver (captain) discovery** within a certain radius of the user
- **Ride booking** with fare estimation and status tracking
- **Robust backend** using Node.js and MongoDB, integrated with public mapping APIs
- **Responsive frontend** built with React.js for an intuitive user experience

---

## Features

- Autocomplete search for addresses using OpenStreetMapâ€™s Nominatim API
- Accurate geocoding and reverse geocoding
- Route planning and distance/time calculation via OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
- MongoDB geospatial queries to find drivers nearby
- RESTful API backend with input validation and error handling
- Frontend with real-time UI updates, map visualizations, and booking flow

## Architecture

```plaintext
User <--> Frontend (React.js) <--> Backend (Node.js + Express) <--> MongoDB
                               |
                               --> External APIs (Nominatim, OSRM)
```
